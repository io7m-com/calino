  <Paragraph>
    A texture file can have associated free-form metadata. This is often used to, for example, express authorship
    information and indicate which tools were used to produce a given file. The metadata supported directly by
    <Term type="package">calino</Term> is in the form of UTF-8 encoded keys and values. Metadata that requires
    more structure than this can be provided by custom
    <Link target="eb66b381-4c70-4246-95e9-d3a61e19ac4c">sections</Link> that will be ignored by software that does
    not know how to interpret them.

  <Paragraph>
    Conceptually, metadata is structured as a function from keys to non-empty lists of values; the values
    associated with multiple occurrences of a given key are expected to be combined into a list of values for
    the given key by consumers.
